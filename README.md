# Description

Fetch A Date is a fun interactive game where you build relationships through dialog with a variety of characters. 

Based on your interactions with the characters your relationship with them will grow or suffer. Characters will respond differently to you based on your relationship with them. When you visit your home, you can see your relationship level with all the characters you have met. 

Additionally you will gain or lose Social Energy based on your interactions with the characters. The Social Energy can be spent to buy gifts, to then give to each character. Each character has a different favorite gift, which you can discover by getting to know them! 

# How to play

	To get started choose a name, password, and paste a link to an image (this will be your user's avatar for the game). Once you Sign Up you will be brought to the city center where you can choose to mingle with the cast of characters. 

	Click on a character to join them at the Java Café to get to know them. The character will prompt the conversation, you can select a reply. Your dialog choice will affect your Social Energy and relationship level. 

	Click on your house on the top left corner of the city center screen to go home, and deliberate about your relationships. 

	At home you can view your relationships and spend your Social Energy to buy rare and exotic gifts for the characters.
